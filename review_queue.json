For example, they could create a process that runs a Trojan horse program repeatedly, consuming CPU cycles and memory, making it difficult for the system to function normally.\n\nHowever, the risk is moderate (60) because this scenario involves exploiting an operating system's vulnerability, which requires some technical expertise.
